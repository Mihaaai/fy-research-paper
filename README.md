#Final Year Research Paper

Due to my university requirements, the paper is done in Romanian.
The paper covers what I have learnt and undergone in the process of building my final year project.
The project is a Spark application running on Azure cloud that processes and analyzes the data that is coming from the Microsoft Academic Graph.
The project is a way of making myself familiar with Spark and Big Data processing, but it can also serve as an example for others. 

My application analyzes the way co-authorship networks are formed in different research people's areas and provides valuable insight into how these cooperation of researches help making oneself more visibile to the press.
If things get succesful enough, a research paper showing the result of my data processing might make it to publication. This time, in English. 

You can find the repo for the spark application documented in this paper right at this link:
